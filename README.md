Environment Monitor
Description 
This project aims to create a client server architecture that connects a userâ€™s client to a Raspberry Pi with environment 
monitoring sensors (Temperature Sensor). The user will be able to see the temperature in a remote 
location where a raspberry pi is set up. 

Getting Started 
Install 

Download repository
Run SensorCode on Raspberry Pi

Pinout for DHT sensor

Signal Pin -> pin 7
VCC -> Pin 2
Ground -> Pin 6

Keep both DataStore.txt, ClientSocket.py, and ClientDisplay.py in the same folder
Download and install all libraries that you do not have (Tkinter, Matplotlib, Adafruit DHT Tempreture Sensor)
Connect both the Raspberry Pi and Client PC to the same LAN
Input the Raspberry Pi IP address into the HOST field in ClientSocket.py
Run ClientDisplay.py and then ClientSocket.py



Run (10 pts)
Run the SensorCode.py on the Raspberry Pi
Then, run the ClientDisplay.py code on the client PC.
This should display the GUI and an empty graph on the Living Room Page
Run ClientSocket.py
This will connect the client PC to the SensorCode socket and automatically start streaming and displaying data.
